# Applying Machine Learning to Financial Risk Management Using IBM Watson
Financial institutions need to continually weigh the risks of their
transactions, and they determine their risk level through credit scoring.
Leading up to the 2008-09 financial crisis, almost all large banks used
credit scoring models based on statistical theories; that crisis, largely
brought about by underestimating risk, proved the need for better accuracy
in their scoring. The combination of increased requirements and the
development of advanced new technologies has given rise to a new era:
credit scoring using machine learning.
By this project we can aim to detect, manage, and hedge exposure to
various risks stemming from the use of financial services. First, the
approach is more efficient and allows the bank to do more with less
manpower. Second, it is more effective. The fact that incidents can be
detected earlier allows the bank to prevent them from spiralling out of
control. Third, the system is adaptive. Humans have a great capacity to
adapt to controls imposed on them.
